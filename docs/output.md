# Data Collected & Output
## Data Collected
The following Data is collected:

When run using `kubernetes`

- cluster info is attained from the Nodes - including allocated and max CPU and Memory, number of nodes, and kubelet version
- Helm chart information for charts named like `astronomer` or `airflow` is fetched, sensitive values are redacted.

## `Airflow Report`
This information is saved under the `airflow_report` key, under the `host_type` key and the host key. E.g. `kubernetes.mynamespace|myhost-1234-xyz.airflow_report` or `ssh.my_hostname.airflow_report`

Using python `airflow_report.pyz` is downloaded and executed on the remote host (the host or container running the airflow scheduler). The performance impact of this report is negligible
- `airflow.version.version` output to determine Airflow's version
- `airflow.providers_manager.ProvidersManager`'s output, to determine what providers and versions are installed
- `socket.gethostname()` to determine the hostname
- `pkg_resources` to determine installed python packages and versions
- `airflow.configuration.conf` to determine Airflow configuration settings and what is modified from defaults. Sensitive values are redacted
- `os.environ` to determine what airflow settings, variables, and connections are set via ENV vars. Names only
- the `pools` table is retrieved to list Airflow pools and sizes from the Airflow metadata db
- the `dag` table is inspected from the Airflow metadata db
  - `dags` are read off disk to attain variable and connection names, utilizing the filepath from the `dags` table
- the `connection` table is fetched from the Airflow metadata db
- the `variable` table is fetched from the Airflow metadata db
- the `ab_user` table is fetched from the Airflow metadata db
- the `task_instance` table is analyzed from the Airflow metadata db


There is an intermediate output ending in `*.data.json` which contains all data gathered, and is utilized to generate the report outputs.
The name of this file can vary depending on what options were passed to the tool.

**Output file includes the following sections:**
